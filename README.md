## Project Process Overview

The  chatbot project follows a structured development process that integrates multiple components into a cohesive system. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process flow and implementation details.


# Process Flow:
1. User Interaction Process
   - Application starts and displays URL menu
   - User selects target website
   - System validates selection
   - Scraping process initiates
   - Chat interface becomes available

2. Web Scraping Process
   - URL validation occurs
   - Connection established with target site
   - HTML content retrieved
   - Content cleaned and processed
   - Text extracted and formatted
   - Data prepared for chatbot use

3. Chatbot Operation Process
   - User inputs question
   - Question processed and analyzed
   - Knowledge base consulted
   - Context matching performed
   - Response generated and formatted
   - Answer displayed to user

4. Error Handling Process
   - Input validation performed
   - Network errors caught
   - Content errors managed
   - System state maintained
   - User feedback provided

5. System Management Process
   - Resources monitored
   - Performance tracked
   - Errors logged
   - Session state maintained
   - Clean shutdown when requested

   ## Component Integration:
The system operates through three main components working in concert:

1. Main Controller (main.py)
   The main controller serves as the orchestrator of the entire system. It manages 
   the user interface, coordinates between components, and maintains the program's 
   state. When a user initiates the program, the controller:
   - Presents the URL selection interface
   - Validates user inputs
   - Coordinates the scraping process
   - Manages the chat session
   - Handles program termination

2. Web Scraper (scraper.py)
   The scraping component handles all web content retrieval operations. Upon receiving 
   a URL, it:
   - Validates the URL format
   - Establishes secure connections
   - Downloads page content
   - Processes HTML structure
   - Extracts relevant text
   - Cleans and formats content
   - Returns processed data

3. Chatbot Engine (chatbot.py)
   The chatbot engine processes user questions and generates appropriate responses. 
   Its operation includes:
   - Question analysis
   - Knowledge base consultation
   - Context matching
   - Response generation
   - Answer formatting
   - Error handling

   ## The system's data flow follows a specific pattern:

1. Input Processing
   User input → Input validation → Command processing → Request handling

2. Content Management
   URL selection → Web scraping → Content cleaning → Data storage → Context preparation

3. Response Generation
   Question receipt → Analysis → Knowledge base check → Context matching → 
   Response formatting → Output display

4. Error Management
   Error detection → Classification → Handling → User notification → 
   System state restoration

5. Session Control
   Session initiation → State management → Resource monitoring → 
   Clean termination
